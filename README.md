This is a NodeJS + MongoDB api for a social network app allowing users to register, login, chat, post and edit posts among other features.
 
To use the api clone the files to your environment then use the command `$npm install` to install all dependencies. 
Edit the **config.json** file to match your environment then run the command `$npm test` to conduct unit tests on the api.
To start up the server, first make sure your database is up and running, then use the command `$npm start` to bring the api online. 
The api can then be accessed through **port 4000** of the server.
